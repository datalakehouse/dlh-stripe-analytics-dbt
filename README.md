# Stripe package

This dbt package:

*   Contains a DBT dimensional model based on Stripe data from [Datalakehouseâ€™s](https://www.datalakehouse.io/) connector.
*   The main use of this package is to provide a stable snowflake dimensional model that will provide useful insights.
    

### Models

The primary ouputs of this package are fact and dimension tables as listed below. There are several intermediate models used to create these models.
